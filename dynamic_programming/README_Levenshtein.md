### The Levenshtein distance algorithm
The Levenshtein distance algorithm measures the difference between two sequences 
by counting the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) 
needed to transform one string into the other.
### Where to Use the Levenshtein Distance Algorithm
1.  Spell Checking and Correction: Suggests possible corrections for misspelled words by finding words with the lowest Levenshtein distance from the input.
2.	DNA Sequence Analysis: Used in bioinformatics to measure the similarity between DNA or protein sequences, where small differences may represent mutations.
3.	Plagiarism Detection: Compares documents or code snippets to find similar or duplicate sections.
4.	Data De-duplication: Identifies nearly identical records in databases, such as different spellings or variations of names.
5.	Text-Based Recommendations: Recommends items in search engines or applications by finding terms similar to the input.

### Explanation

	•	The dp matrix is initialized with 1 in each cell, representing the number of ways to reach each cell if it’s in the first row or the first column (only one path to each of those cells by moving strictly right or down).
	•	For each cell not in the first row or first column, the number of ways to get to that cell is the sum of the ways to get to the cell above (dp[i-1][j]) and the cell to the left (dp[i][j-1]).
	•	The bottom-right cell (dp[m-1][n-1]) holds the final answer.

### Where to Use the Unique Paths Algorithm

	1.	Robotic Path Planning: Useful in grid-based environments for robots that can only move in specific directions, such as moving right or down.
	2.	Game Development: In grid-based games, it can help determine the number of possible ways for a character to reach a destination.
	3.	Dynamic Programming Problems: Serves as an educational example of solving problems with DP by breaking down larger problems into overlapping subproblems.
	4.	Logistics and Routing: Can be applied to scenarios where items need to be routed through a grid-like layout with constraints on movement directions.

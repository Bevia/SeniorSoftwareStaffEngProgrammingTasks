# 1) find the fibonacci for n = 8 for time complexity O(2^n), and O(n)


# 2) find the pairs of number that add up to 11 from this array
# arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9]
# notice that there might be more than one pair, don't allow duplicates

# 3) use linear search to find index of number 6 in this array: arr = [2, 7, 1, 6, 8, 9]

# 4) use binary search to find value 7 in the array
# arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9]
